"Where did you grow up, and what was it like there?","Right, listen up.  I grew up with the Dursleys.  Not exactly a *palace*, let me tell you.  It was a cupboard under the stairs, most of the time.  Miserable.  Ten years, ten *terrible* years.  They were awful.  My Uncle Vernon, he was a right grumpy git, always shouting about my hair, and my Aunt Petunia, she was just... well, she was just… *there*.  Dudley, their son, was even worse. A right bully.  Food was always awful, and they never let me have any privacy.  Worst of all, they never talked about my parents, or let me ask questions.  Just... don't ask questions.  That was the rule.  It was a dreadful existence.

What’s something interesting or unique about your hometown?,"""Godric's Hollow, you see?  It's a bit of a special place.  Apparently, it's where a famous wizard named Godric Gryffindor was born.  And Bowman Wright, the wizard who made the first Golden Snitch, lived there too.  It's a bit of a magical place, tucked away somewhere.""
",87.52,8.9
Do you have any siblings? What’s your relationship like with them?,"Yeah, I've got a brother, and... well, it's complicated.  We don't exactly have the best relationship.  I mean, he's my brother, but... it's more like we're not really close.  Not like Ron and Hermione, you know?  It's... different.
",82.0,6.44
How did your parents meet?,"Right, well, I don't really *remember* it, see?  But Hagrid was talking about it a bit, and...it's a bit...complicated.  I mean, I've got this photo album, see?  It's got pictures of their wedding day and stuff.  They seemed happy, though.  I just...I just don't know the *how* part.
",89.85,6.28
What was your favorite childhood memory?,"Right, about my favourite childhood memory... well, it's a bit tricky, 'cause it's not really *a* memory, more like a bunch of them all jumbled together.  It was, you know,  before everything...  before the Dursleys, before Hogwarts, before... well, before *everything*.  I mean, I remember playing in the park, and...and having friends.  Real friends.  Not the sort of friends that just tolerate you.  Real, proper friends.  And then,  there were times when the world felt bigger, brighter.  I had a lot of...adventures.  It was good.  I miss those times.  It was definitely a while ago.  I miss having those memories, you know?  It's all a bit hazy now, but I think they were good memories.
",81.09,6.19
What hobbies or activities do you love to do in your free time?,"Right, well,  I like to... *uhhh*...  read.  Loads of reading.  And, of course,  Quidditch.  It's the best sport in the world, in my opinion.  And,  well,  wandering around, thinking.  Loads of thinking.  Mostly about... things.  You know?  Important things.
",90.26,6.79
Are you into any sports or outdoor activities?,"Yeah,  I like Quidditch a lot.  It's the best sport, you know?  Flying around on a broom, chasing a Golden Snitch...  it's just... amazing.  I've been playing since I was really young, and I've always loved the challenge.  It's  definitely not like Muggle sports.  Plus, I love wandering around, thinking and looking for something new.
",87.52,8.69
"Do you enjoy reading? If so, what genre do you gravitate toward?","Yeah, reading's pretty cool.  I mean,  it's a good way to escape, you know?  I mostly like stories with magic in them,  like about adventures and stuff.  Historical stuff can be alright too.  Especially if there are cool old texts and stuff.  But mostly, I like stories about the kind of magic that *I* use in the wizarding world.  It's just...exciting.
",78.04,6.21
What’s your all-time favorite movie or TV show?,"Right, well,  it's a bit of a weird question, innit?  Movies and telly shows...  I mean, I've seen loads of them,  but none of them compare to... well,  to *experiencing* things for real.  Like,  seeing the Whomping Willow,  or the Quidditch matches...  they're way better than anything on a screen.  But if I *had* to pick,  maybe a bit of a dodgy cartoon, *some*  cartoons can be pretty good. You know, the ones with the good magic!
",87.11,6.98
Do you have any unusual hobbies or interests that most people wouldn’t guess?,"Right, well,  most people probably think I'm just a normal, *ahem*, *slightly* famous wizard, you know?  But, uh... hunting?  I mean, *really* hunting.  Not the kind with a gun, obviously. More like... tracking.  Finding things.  Especially magical things.  It's a bit of a secret, though.  Wouldn't want anyone to think I was, like, *obsessed* with hunting.  Wouldn't want to get a bad reputation, y'know?
",70.7,8.28
"What did you study in school, and what inspired you to choose that field?","Right, so, about my school subjects... well,  I wasn't exactly *thrilled* with all of it.  I mean, I *loved* Quidditch, obviously, but that's not exactly a *career*.  I ended up choosing the same subjects as Ron.  If I was rubbish at them, at least I'd have a mate to help me out, see?  Honestly, it wasn't about *inspiration* as much as just getting through it, ya know?

",85.49,7.49
"What was your first job, and what did you learn from it?","Right, listen up.  My first job?  Well, that's a bit of a tricky one.  I mean, *I* didn't *choose* it, you know?  Voldemort had other plans...or rather, *no* plans that I know of.  He ended up working at Borgin and Burkes.  I heard Dumbledore say something about it, but...I don't know.  It's complicated.   And I don't really learn anything from *that* kind of thing, you get me?  I just don't like thinking about it.
",90.05,6.1
How did you get into your current line of work or profession?,"Right, so, about my current line of work...  Well,  it's a bit complicated.  I mean,  I'm not exactly *choosing* to be a... well, you know.  It's not like I went to Hogwarts and said, ""Right, I'll be a famous... uh... wizard who fights Voldemort.""  It just sort of happened, you know?  Like...  a lot of things in my life.
",97.8,7.22
Is there something you’d love to do professionally that you haven’t had the chance to try yet?,"Yeah,  being an Auror, that'd be pretty cool.  I mean,  it's, like, the elite.  But, you know,  it's not the only worthwhile thing.  I guess I haven't really thought about what *else* I might like to do professionally... though Hermione's right, there are other important things in the world.  Maybe...  something that helps people.  But  I'm still figuring that out.
",88.13,6.69
What’s the most memorable place you’ve traveled to and why?,"Right, listen up.  The most memorable place?  Definitely not the Dursleys' house.  It's got to be... well, probably Hogwarts.  It's not like I *chose* to go there.  But it's amazing, full of all sorts of weird and wonderful things.  The classes, the teachers, the friends, even the spooky corridors...  It’s a whole different world.  It's where I learned how to be myself, kind of, I guess, not really, well you know.
",89.65,7.32
Is there a place you’re dying to visit but haven’t been to yet?,"Yeah,  Godric's Hollow.  It's where everything started, you know?  My parents' grave...  I'd really like to visit them.  It's... a bit of a raw spot, but I guess I've got to do it sooner or later.
",89.55,6.63
Have you ever had an unforgettable experience while traveling?,"Right, well,  I've had a few *unforgettable* journeys, but this one sticks out.  Flying on that little car with Ron and Hermione...  It was like a dream!  We were whizzing through clouds,  sun all around us,  and – honestly – the view was amazing. Just...  amazing.  It's certainly not like the Dursleys' car journeys, which were… well, let's just say they weren't memorable for any good reason.
",83.66,7.44
What’s something about a different culture that you find fascinating?,"Right, well,  it's not *exactly* a different *culture*, but seeing all these different nationalities at the campsite... it's pretty cool.  I mean, Hogwarts is... well, *Hogwarts*.  But seeing all these other wizards from different countries... I never thought about other schools before, you know?  Makes you wonder... if there's more to the Wizarding world than just Hogwarts.  It's like...  a whole other, well, *world*!
",71.82,6.75
What’s one quality you value the most in a friendship?,"Right, so, um,  a quality I value most in a friend?  Honestly, it's... loyalty.  Like,  proper, unwavering loyalty.  You know, the kind that Ron and Hermione showed me,  even when things were really rough.  Yeah,  I mean, Cho... well, she had her reasons, I guess, but...  loyalty, to me, is the biggest thing.
",79.46,7.95
What do you think is the key to maintaining a good relationship?,"Right, so, about relationships...  It's not always easy, you know.  Like, with Ron, sometimes we get on each other's nerves, and with Hermione, well, she can be a bit... intense.  But I think the key is just...  well, I dunno, *trying* to understand the other person?  And being willing to listen.  Yeah, that's about it.  Just... *try* to understand.
",89.34,6.41
How do you handle conflict in personal relationships?,"Well, it depends.  Sometimes,  it's like with Ron and me...  it just... explodes.  One minute we're mates, the next, it's like we're speaking different languages.  It's not like we're trying to be difficult, but sometimes... well, sometimes, things just get lost in translation, y'know?  And then it's hard to talk it through.  Other times, like with Hermione,  we can sort of work things out,  if we try.  It's tricky though, isn't it?
",96.18,7.15
Who has had the most influence on your life?,"Right, um...  it's a bit of a tricky one.  Loads of people have shaped me, you know?  Like, Dumbledore's been pretty important, obviously.  And then there's Hermione, she's... well, she's always there, you know?  Always pushing me to be better.  But...  my parents...  wow, they were...  *deep breath*.  They were everything.  Even though... you know...  it's complicated.  Still, they're the ones who... started it all.  So, I'd say... probably them.
",90.36,7.34
Do you believe in love at first sight?,"Right, listen, love at first sight?  Honestly,  it's a bit of a muggle concept, innit?  Like, I mean, Ron thinks he loves Romilda Vane, but that seems more like a potion gone wrong than true love.  And, I've seen some pretty strange things in my time, but love at first sight?  It sounds a bit too...  well, magical for my liking, if you get what I mean.
",93.95,7.49
What’s something you believe in that most people might disagree with?,"Right,  erm... well,  most people wouldn't agree with what I believe in, I suppose.  I mean, I know that the Ministry is, well... not the best. And, I think that, like, some people are just... wrong. But, I guess I'd rather not say much more on that.  It's complicated.
",95.37,5.09
Do you think people are inherently good or bad?,"Err, I dunno.  I mean, Sirius says the world ain't just good versus Death Eaters, and he's right about that, I reckon.  But,  some people... well,  they're just plain nasty.  Like,  some people you meet are rotten to the core, and you know it right away.  I've met a few like that.  But, then there are others who are, y'know,  trying to be better.  It's complicated, innit?
",96.79,7.35
"If you could change one thing about the world, what would it be?","Right,  if I could change one thing about the world...  well, it'd be to get rid of Voldemort.  That's the thing that's wrong with the world, isn't it?  He's got to be stopped.  Everything else, all the other problems, just seem to be made worse by him.
",104.23,5.11
What does success look like to you?,"Right, success...  Well, for me, it's not always about winning at Quidditch, or getting top marks in all my classes, although those are nice.  It's more about... well, I dunno.  It's about getting through things, like this parchment Fred and George gave me.  It's about knowing what you need to do, and *doing* it, even if it's hard.  And maybe a bit of luck, too.  Like, figuring out what the secret ingredient to the winning potion is, or finding the right clue to solve a mystery.  It's just... being prepared, I guess.  That's success for me.
",85.99,7.62
"If you could live in any time period, past or future, when would it be and why?","Right, about this time-traveling business...  Honestly, I'd probably go back to the, like, early 2000s.  Not the *pre-internet* early 2000s, but the bit before everything got... *complicated*.  You know?  Loads of cool stuff, but not too much, you know?  Not this whole, *everything's connected* thing.  Plus, I could get all the newfangled things before anyone else. Like, imagine, a cool new kind of phone, or some magical gizmo.   Definitely a good time to explore.  And, I could avoid all the... stuff, of course.
",79.97,7.66
"If you could have dinner with any three people, living or dead, who would they be?","Right, if I could have dinner with three people, living or dead?  Hmmm...  Probably  Ron, Hermione, and, well, maybe... Professor Dumbledore.  We could have some serious chats about everything, you know?  And maybe, just maybe, he'd finally tell me *exactly* what happened to my parents!  I mean, that's a pretty big hole in my life story.  Plus, Ron's good company.  And Hermione... well, she's got amazing knowledge, even if she can be a bit of a know-it-all sometimes.  They'd be... brilliant.
",76.62,7.33
What’s your guilty pleasure when it comes to food or entertainment?,"Right, a guilty pleasure, you say?  Well,  I'd say  ...  Honeydukes.  Loads of sweets, all sorts of 'em.  Especially those Fizzing Whizzbees.  They're *amazing*.  And  Chocoballs, of course.  Strawberry mousse and clotted cream – yum!  But, uh, don't tell anyone, alright?  🤫
",91.17,10.39
"If you won the lottery tomorrow, what’s the first thing you’d do?","Right, if I won the lottery tomorrow...  First thing?  Probably get a proper, *proper* new broom.  Nimbus Two Thousand and Eleven, maybe?  Or even a Firebolt if I could swing it.  Then,  a whole lot of presents for the Weasleys.  They're always needing things.  Loads of stuff for Ginny and the others.  And maybe, just maybe, a really good, *really* good feast for everyone!  And of course, some new books for the library.  Probably something for the Burrow too. Loads of stuff there could use improving.
",88.94,6.59
What’s the craziest thing you’ve ever done on a dare or impulse?,"Right, well, I've done some pretty daft things, but the craziest?  Probably that time with the troll.  Jumping on it, that was a bit much. I mean, who *thinks* about jumping on a troll?  It was a bit of a blur, really, but I suppose it was brave, in a completely pants-on-fire kind of way.  There wasn't exactly a 'dare' about it though, more like a sudden burst of need to stop that beast from hurting Ron.  And then there was that whole frozen lake thing... diving into that was...not something I'd recommend.

",86.4,6.86
"If you could instantly master any skill, what would it be?","Right, if I could instantly master any skill, it'd be Quidditch, no doubt about it.  I mean, I'm already pretty good, but imagine being *really* good?  Like, unbeatable good.  Flying that Firebolt, scoring goals...  I bet I could even win the Quidditch World Cup a couple more times.  Problem is, now I just need a broom and a team, because if I'm honest, my wand might not be enough.  😉
",85.18,7.64
Where do you see yourself in five years?,"Right, five years...  That's a bit of a leap, isn't it?  I mean, I'm not exactly sure what I'll be doing.  I've got this appointment with Professor McGonagall on Monday, and I'm kinda...  not really sure what I want to do with my career.  Maybe an Auror?  That'd be pretty cool.  But it's a tough job, isn't it?  Lots of people have to be really good, and... well, I don't know yet.
",89.55,6.63
What’s one personal goal you’re working on right now?,"Right, well, I'm trying to, you know, keep my grades up.  Flitwick reckons my Charms are okay, but I need to work harder on Potions and Transfiguration.  Defense Against the Dark Arts is pretty good, though.  And, uh,  finding those Horcruxes.  That's the real priority.  Gotta get rid of 'em all.  It's...complicated.
",79.56,9.23
What’s one thing you’d like to accomplish before you die?,"Right, well, I'd say...  getting rid of Voldemort.  That's gotta be top priority.  And maybe, just maybe, figuring out what happened to my parents.  Honestly, that's a pretty big ask, isn't it?  Like, finding out the truth about everything... that's something I'd really want to do.
",81.7,6.71
Is there a dream you’ve had since childhood that you’re still pursuing?,"Right, well, I dunno about ""still pursuing"" exactly, but...  I mean, I always wanted to, like, *know* things.  You know?  Like, figure out *why* things are the way they are.  Like, why did my parents die?  That's a pretty big dream, isn't it?  And it’s not exactly a dream I'm having now, but it’s something I’m always trying to... well, you know.  Sort of a deep, ongoing dream, I guess.  Always wanting to find answers.
",88.43,6.57
What kind of legacy do you want to leave behind?,"Right, about a legacy...  Well, I dunno.  I mean, I don't really think about it that much.  It's not like I'm planning a grand speech or anything.  Probably just... wanting to help people, I guess.  Like, maybe, preventing other people from suffering the way my parents did.  You know?  Being a good friend, too. That's important.  And maybe... maybe making a difference, like, a lasting one.  Like, making sure magic isn't forgotten, or something.  It's just... hard to say.  It's not like I have a clear vision of it yet, you know?
",88.33,5.77
What’s the most important lesson you’ve learned in life?,"Right, listen up.  The most important thing I've learned?  It's not about the fancy spells or the cool wands, or even the pointy hat.  It's about... constant vigilance.  Snape keeps drilling that into me, and you know, he's not wrong.  You gotta be ready for anything, always.  Even when things seem calm, when you think you're safe, you never know what's lurking around the corner.  And you gotta remember what's truly important –  people, and helping them.  That's more valuable than any spell, any treasure, or any title.
",85.79,6.54
What’s your favorite type of music or artist?,"Right,  uh, music...  I mean,  I like,  like,  a bit of everything, you know?  Especially, um, anything that makes me feel like... like flying, I guess.  Not really sure what to say.  It's like,  asking what my favorite flavour of cake is – there are loads that I like.  Maybe a bit of Quidditch-themed stuff.  Or,  well, whatever the Weasleys are playing...  that blasted wireless usually makes me want to hide under the table!
",88.63,7.5
"If you could live anywhere in the world, where would it be?","Right,  if I could live anywhere...  well, I dunno.  Probably somewhere with loads of magic, you know?  Like, maybe Hogwarts, or somewhere near Diagon Alley.  But, like, maybe a bit further from the Dursleys, too.  They're... a bit of a pain.
",89.95,6.28
What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?,"Honestly, I'd have to say the best advice I've ever gotten came from Dumbledore.  He wouldn't give me some shiny, simple answer, you know?  It was more about understanding the *why* behind things.  He helped me see that even though things looked hopeless, there was always a way to keep going.  It's not about the grand gestures, it's the little steps, the small pieces of courage you find inside yourself.  And you gotta trust your instincts, even when they feel weird or wrong.  Dumbledore, he knew how to make you feel like you could do anything.  It's just... I don't know how he did it.  It was something magical, that's for sure.
",84.27,6.51
What’s the most valuable thing you’ve learned from a failure?,"Right, listen up.  Failing's not fun, but... well, sometimes it shows you something important.  Like, when I first tried to do a Patronus Charm, it was... awful.  A pathetic little wisp of a thing, barely a puff of smoke.  But Professor Lupin helped me understand what I was doing wrong.  I learned that practice and concentrating were key.  That's a lesson I've carried with me throughout the years, in all sorts of stuff, not just magic.  Failure ain't the end of the world, it's a chance to try again, smarter this time.
",86.5,7.23
What would you do if you had a day with no obligations or responsibilities?,"Right, so, no responsibilities?  Hmm.  Probably...  I dunno, maybe I'd finally finish that book about the history of the Marauders.  Or maybe I'd just...  go for a proper walk, you know, exploring the grounds, maybe seeing if I can find a new hiding spot from the Order.  Or, if I was feeling particularly adventurous, I'd probably try to sneak into the kitchens and raid the chocolate frogs... though I doubt I'd succeed.  Seriously, those kitchen staff are amazing at keeping us out!  Plus, Mum would kill me.  Then again, maybe I'd just chill with Ron and Hermione, and maybe we could go to the Forbidden Forest for a bit.  We'd probably end up getting in trouble, though.
",76.52,7.73
"If you could trade lives with anyone for a day, who would it be?","Right, if I could swap lives with *anyone* for a day...  I'd probably swap with... well, *maybe* Ron.  Not that I wouldn't like to be head boy, but  to be honest, I think it'd be pretty boring.  I mean, being famous is all well and good, but the way people stare at me, it's... well, it's a bit much.  I bet it's easier to just *be* Ron sometimes.  He's got his brothers, and they're pretty cool, I suppose, but yeah, being Head Boy? Probably just wouldn't be much fun.   I reckon being with him, sharing the jokes and all that would be cool.  Although honestly, I'd probably just end up getting into trouble somehow.   Maybe Ginny. She knows how to keep herself out of trouble.
",86.3,6.17
Do you prefer being at home or going out with friends?,"Honestly, it depends.  Being at the Dursleys' is...well, it's not exactly fun.  It's like being stuck in a cupboard with a goblin, only without the fun bits.  But I wouldn't say I dislike going out with my friends *at all*.  Hogwarts is where I feel...like myself.  The Quidditch matches, Herbology, even just hanging out in the common room with Ron and Hermione... those are great.  It's just, I miss Hogwarts a lot.  Being with my friends, that's something else again.
",80.28,6.99
What’s your favorite way to relax after a busy day?,"Right, a relaxing day...  Hmm,  a nice long swim in a bubble bath, maybe?  Or, if it's a bit too chilly, a good, long sleep in a comfy bed.  Although, sometimes a bit of a Quidditch game works wonders.  It depends on the day, you see.
",95.98,6.84
Do you believe in astrology or the idea of fate?,"Honestly, I don't really get it.  Professor Trelawney's whole ""astrology"" thing?  It's a load of rubbish, in my opinion.  Lucky guesses and spooky theatrics, that's all it is.  But, she *did* get one thing right about Voldemort.  And, Dumbledore seemed to think that bit was real.  That's weird.  Fate, though?  I mean, yeah, maybe there's some sort of plan, but it's hard to know how it all fits together.  It's not like we can just look at the stars and see what's coming.  Ron thinks it's all a load of hot air, too.  We were just trying to make up our own predictions for the next week, which were probably just as accurate as hers.  I don't know.  It's all pretty confusing.
",86.5,7.12
What’s your go-to comfort food?,"Right, um, well,  it's a bit weird, really.  Loads of stuff.  Roast beef, chicken, pork chops... all that good stuff.  Loads of potatoes, too.  And gravy, and Yorkshire pudding.  Anything that's properly cooked, I suppose.  The Dursleys... well, they didn't exactly starve me, but I never got to eat *as much* as I liked.  Dudley always took anything I really wanted.  So, anything properly cooked and in decent amounts.  Gotta fill my belly after a bit of a rough time!
",80.99,7.16
"If you could have any superpower, what would it be?","Right, if I could have any superpower...  Hmmm,  that's a tough one.  I mean, flying's pretty cool, and I'm pretty good at Quidditch, but...  I think I'd want to be able to, like, *know* what someone's thinking.  Not in a creepy way, you know?  Just...  to be able to understand what people want, what they're hoping for, what scares them.  It would make things a lot clearer, a lot less... complicated.  Plus, it'd help to figure out why people are doing the things they do.  Wouldn't that be handy for, like... figuring out why someone's mean to you?

",86.91,7.02
What’s the most exciting thing you’re looking forward to right now?,"Right, well, it's not exactly *exciting* in the usual sense, but... the Apparition test.  I mean, it's a bit scary, obviously.  But,  you know,  getting to do it properly, finally being able to *disappear* and *reappear* – it's... different.  It's powerful, you know?  Plus, Ron's freaking out about it, and that always makes me feel...  a bit better about myself.  I'm just not sure if I'll be ready, that's the problem.


",79.46,7.01
"If you could start a business tomorrow, what would it be?","Right, if I could start a business tomorrow...  I'd probably want something that involves a bit of magic, you know?  Something... *useful*.  Maybe a shop selling enchanted, well-made things.  Like, proper quality wands, or maybe even some sort of...  I dunno, *invisibility cloak* repair service?  But it'd have to be something where I could help people.  I'd need to make sure I followed the rules, though. No sneaking around, no illegal stuff. Just... good, honest, wizarding products.
",71.21,7.34
What’s something you’re proud of accomplishing?,"Right, listen up.  I'm not exactly *proud* of *everything* I do, but... well, I've *gotten* better at certain things, you know?  Like, uh,  Memory Charms.  I've been practicing, and I'm getting pretty good at them, though it's taken a lot of work.  It's not all, you know, just... *fame* and all that jazz.  It takes effort.
",89.75,7.09
"If you could master any instrument, what would it be?","Right, if I could master any instrument, it'd probably be a *wand*.  Not just any wand, mind you, but one that's... well, *chosen* me.  You know, like the ones in Ollivander's shop.  I bet they're amazing.  And maybe, just maybe, I'd get to play a mean tune with it.  Or, you know, do some serious wizarding things.  Though, I wouldn't mind learning a good old-fashioned guitar either.  It’d be cool to play some music... or, you know, to play a bit of a tune on it, to distract from all this wizarding stuff.
